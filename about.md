I am **Trung Le**, 22, Vietnamese. I graduated from the HCMC University of Science (Vietnam) with a major in computer science. I'm currently working as a data scientist at Zalo group (https://zalo.me/). In my free time, I'd like to play Dota2 with my friends, surfing Youtube, dating with my girl friend. At weekends, I grab foods and support my favorite football team, the Arsenal.

The purpose of this blog is to force myself to write, cause writing is a good way to make sure you really understand what you've learnt and to explore new things.

I am a first year Ph.D student in Department of Computer Science, New Mexico State University. My ongoing researches are related to how to incorporate background knowledge into neural networks systems.  

I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Huiping Cao](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~hcao/) as my advisor.

My research interests are in the field of data mining, machine learning and neural-symbolic deep learning.
I have experience working with social network, graph data and recommendation systems.

I graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam with a degree in computer science. I had about 1.5 years working as research engineer at [Trusting Social](https://trustingsocial.com/).

I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Huiping Cao](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~hcao/) and [Tran Cao Son](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~tson/) as my advisors.

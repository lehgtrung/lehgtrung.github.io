I am starting my third year of my Ph.D at Department of Computer Science, New Mexico State University. My ongoing 
researches are related to how to effectively incorporate symbolic knowledge into neural network models to reduce labor 
costs and make them capable of reasoning with common sense.

I graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam with a degree in computer science. I had about 1.5 years working as research engineer at [Trusting Social](https://trustingsocial.com/).

I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Huiping Cao](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~hcao/) and [Tran Cao Son](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~tson/) as my advisors.

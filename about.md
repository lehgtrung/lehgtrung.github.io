I am starting my third year of my Ph.D at Department of Computer Science, New Mexico State University. My ongoing 
researches are related to how to effectively incorporate symbolic knowledge into neural network models to reduce labor 
costs and make them capable of reasoning with common sense.  

I am very fortunate to have Prof. [Huiping Cao](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~hcao/) and [Tran Cao Son](https://www.cs.nmsu.edu/~tson/) as my advisors.

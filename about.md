The target audience of this blog is myself, I learnt a lot when I wrote these posts. For me, writing is the best way to
 make sure you really understand what youâ€™ve learnt and to explore new things.
 
 My name is Trung Le, I graduated from Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Vietnam with a major in computer science.
